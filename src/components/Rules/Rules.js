1. **Overview:** 
The Scratch Masters is an optional, mixed competition with a separate entry fee, open to all SFGGC participants.
1. **Divisions & Fees:**
    *  Division A: 208+ ($55)
    *  Division B: 190-207 ($50)

    *  Division D: 150-169 ($40)
    *  Division E: 0-149 ($35)
    *  Tournament Director(s) may adjust a bowler’s division before they bowl.
1. **Qualification:** 
Scratch scores from Doubles, Singles, and Team events determine the top 8 qualifiers and one alternate per division (no handicap). A tie for 8th is settled with a 9th-and-10th-frame roll-off.
1. **Competition Format:**
    * Qualifiers bowl 3 games each on rotating lanes. The four (4) lowest scores are eliminated, and the remaining 4 advance. Ties are broken by a one-ball roll-off.
    * The top 4 bowlers compete in a head-to-head stepladder format, with previous scores discarded. Higher-seeded bowlers choose to finish first or last.
1. **Practice & Timing:** 
Qualifiers get 10 minutes of practice before competition. Bowlers must be checked in 30 minutes before the start or be replaced by the alternate.
1.  **Match Timing:** 
Matches begins on the final day of the Tournament (Sunday) at 10am. Each division bowls on separate lanes.
1.  **Errors & Protests:**
Claims of error during a roll-off must be submitted before the next match begins. For the final match, any error must be reported within one (1) hour of its conclusion.
1.  **Payouts:**
100% of entry fees (less lineage) are paid out with a minimum 1:2 ratio and up to 8 places per division.
1.  **Participation:**
If fewer than 8 bowlers sign up in a division, all participants will bowl in the same format until the top 4 or less remain for stepladder.
